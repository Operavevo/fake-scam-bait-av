if the program asks you for a "product key" enter anything, it doesn't matter
put the number you're calling into the number.txt file
write true into virus.txt if you want the av to display a "virus found" message, and false if you want it to display your pc as clean
if you are using version 2.0 virus.txt no longer does anything config.ini has that job you also don't have to change it by hand anymore, jut open settings from the menu bar of the program.
